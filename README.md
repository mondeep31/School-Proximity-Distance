## School Management API

Developed an API that helps users to find schools nearest to the specified location. Built using Node.js and Express.js and utilizes a MySQL Database hosted remote for better accessibility. The API calculates the proximity of schools to a user's location using the Haversine formula for most accurate distance measurement based on latitude and longitude. 

## API Endpoints: 

addSchool: Allows users to add new schools to the database by providin essential details like name, address, latitude and longitude. 
listSchools: Retrieves a list of schools sorted by proximity to the user's specified location in a sorted manner(nearest first), making it easier for users to find nearby schools in no time.

## Technologies and References Used: 

Node.js and Express.js for API development
MySQL for database
Haversine formula for accurate distance calculations
Postman for API testing and documentation.

The API ensures data integrity and prevents duplicate entries through validation. This project helped me strengthen my backend development skills with a scope for further integration in full stack applications.

You can clone this and test it locally. But for ease, I have deployed it and you can test it by following the below steps.

1. Open Postman in your System
2. Import the School Management APIs Collection, that is stored in this repository, into postman and you're good to test the application and the result will be displayed as per the expected output.
3. Feel free to change the inputs and test as per your wish
