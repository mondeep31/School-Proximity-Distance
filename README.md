## School Management API

This project is a School Management API built using Node.js and Express.js with a MySQL database. The API allows users to manage school data, including adding new schools and retrieving a list of schools by proximity(latitude and longitude) to a specified location(user specified location).
You can clone this and test it locally. But for ease, I have deployed it and you can test it by following the below steps.

1. Open Postman in your System
2. Import the School Management APIs Collection, that is stored in this repository, into postman and you're good to test the application and the result will be displayed as per the expected output.
3. Feel free to change the inputs and test as per your wish
